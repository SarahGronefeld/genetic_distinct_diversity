To use these scripts you should create an R project. 
Open the main script. 
The function show_menu() in the end of main script will guide you through the calculation methods: lambda, AMOVA, allelic overlap, Ne calculations and AvTD. If you want to use the genetic_D&D__Overlaps.R Script you should install EcoSimR into your R project first (https://www.uvm.edu/~ngotelli/EcoSim/EcoSim.html). genetic_D&D_Speed_Ne_split_input.R was used to create a single table for each location so that they can be read into Speed Ne individually. You can run the script to calculate correlations and the script to identify KBAs only after running all methods with all data sets, which have been used in the corresponding paper. genetic_D&D__correlations_Delta_dist.R requires another folder structure: this script should be in a folder together with genetic_D&D_functions.R and genetic_D&D_libraries.R and four folders namend Edwards, Nei, pairwise and taxa2dist. Within each of the four folders are all genetic_D&D scripts accept the correlations_Delta_dist script together with the results of all methods. The only results that change between the folders are the AvTD/Delta+ results. Within the Edwards, the Nei, and the pairwise folder genetic_D&D__AvTD.R should be executed again for all datasets with a defined distance method (distance_method <- "Nei" or "Edward" or "pairwise").
