To use these scripts you should create an R project. 
Open the Main Script. 
The function show_menu() in the end of Main Script will guide you through the calculation methods: lambda, AMOVA, allelic overlap, Ne calculations and AvTD. If you want to use the genetic_D&D__Overlaps.R Script you should install EcoSimR into your R project first (https://www.uvm.edu/~ngotelli/EcoSim/EcoSim.html). You can run the correlation script and the KBA criteria script only after running all methods with all data sets, which have been used in corresponding paper. To compare Ne Estimator and Speed Ne genetic_D&D__compare_NeENeS.R was developed and is based on the data calculated before.
