To use these scripts you should create an R project. 
Open the Main Script. 
Use the function show_menu() in the end of the script to get additional information and help how to use this program.
If you want to use the genetic_D&D__Overlaps.R Script you should install EcoSimR into your R project first (https://www.uvm.edu/~ngotelli/EcoSim/EcoSim.html).
